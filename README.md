# COP3375-Assignment01
In this assignment, we will develop an algorithm to calculate the final grade for a class of 15 students.  
There are 5 assignments (20 points each) as well a midterm and a final (100 points each).  
Another 10 points are for in-class participation.   
All the assignments and tests contribute to the final grade equally. 
Additionally, the in-class participation (either thru Discussions or in real-time) is also a part of the final grade.  
This is a fairly simple assignment and we will use it to get into the habit of following good design and coding practices.  
For brief examples of good documentation review some of the material at: 
http://noeticforce.com/best-free-tutorials-to-learn-python-pdfs-ebooks-online-interactive . (Links to an external site.)  
First, we analyze the problem (perhaps break it into a couple of pieces), develop a flow-chart or pseudocode. 
Include the pseudocode in your program as comments. (5 points)  
Next, we code the algorithm in Python along with comments and documentation, and make sure it runs successfully.  
For the code, we define a MAIN program (or driver) as well as a few functions and methods (e.g. get_grades, cumulate_total_points, determine_final_grade, ....) 
These should be invoked by the driver via function calls and with arguments passed back and forth. (13 points)   
In the end we display all the students net-ID and their final grade in a table format.  
Since this is an interactive program, make sure we display meaningful headings and instructions/prompts to the end-user. 
Also please up load the .py file for me to execute. Note: the .py file should be uploaded - not your executed code.
